# Library Information System (LIS)  
   <br>
   
   <h3> Functional Requirements: </h3>
   <br>
   
   1. **Registration:**
   
Any institute member (students, faculty members, staff members, etc.) who wants to access the library's resources must register with LIS. They will be given a user ID and password after properly registering. They must use this information for any upcoming LIS transactions.
   
   2. **Login:**
   
A registered user of LIS can log in to the system by entering his user ID/email ID and password.
   
   **Unsuccessful Login:**  
   
   A user must be signed up with LIS to access the system and will instead see a notification about signing up.
 <br><br>
   Users who forget their password will be prompted to answer the security question they chose when registering. If they provide the correct answer, a new password will be provided to their email address, allowing them to log back in and reset their password at that point. The user's account will be frozen if they cannot correctly answer the security question, and they will need to contact the administrator to reactivate it.
   
   **Successful Login:**  
   
   
  After successfully logging in, the user will be redirected to the LIS website's home page, from which he can access the many LIS features like:
   - search book
   - issue book
   - return book
   - reissue book
   - deadline extention of book etc.
   
   <br>
   
  3. **Search book:** 
   
  After successfully logging in, the user will be redirected to the LIS website's home page, from which he can access the many LIS features like:
   
 - Title
 - Authors name
 - Publisher's name
 - Keywords
 - Subject etc.
   
After searching, the user will see relevant books; he can carefully review the list and choose the appropriate book.
  
   4. **Issue book:** 
   
Any member of LIS can issue a book if:
   
  - The book is available in the library. 
  - The user has yet to be issued the maximum number of books he can.
  - No other member has currently issued the same book.
   
The book is given to the member if the aforementioned requirements are satisfied. The user account is updated to reflect the successful issuance of a book.
   
   **Reissue book:**
   
 Any member who has issued a book may find that his obligation has yet to be satisfied by the allotted time. In that case, he might decide to reissue the book and retain it for another finite number of days. A member may renew any book a limited number of times (perhaps two or three), after which he must return it. The user account is updated to reflect the new information once a book has been successfully reissued.

   
   5. **Return book:** 
   
 A book is issued for a finite time. Once issued, the book must be returned within a set amount of time. The user account is updated to reflect the triumphant return of a book.
